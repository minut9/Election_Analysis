# Purpose
This project is an election audit to help Seth and Tom with a submission to the election commission. The code dissects the election results of Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe Counties and uses python to analyze the data. The code used depicts a clear winner of the election while also tallying the votes per county and candidate, as well as percentages for comparison.
